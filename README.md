This is a github repository created by Wendy Vit for working
through the book *Introduction to Programming with Python*
by the Launch School. It's part of the Launch School Prep
Course PY100 Programming & Back-end Prep with Python.

Directories within this repository correspond to chapters in 
the book.

In each directory, there's a separate file with python code for
every exercise in the corresponding chapter of the book.
